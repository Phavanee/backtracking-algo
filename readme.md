# updates
halfway through the project i realized that a backtracking algorithm was only feasible only if i let two computers play against each other, and let one computer be able to backtrack... oops?    
but since i was making a game with a player against a computer, this project would have to be indefinitely put on hold until i feel confident enough to build a backtracking algorithm (probably when i finally take my dsa classes lol)    
for now making tic-tac-toe would just be an exploration into data structures in c++ :)

# tic tac toe
welcome to my tic tac toe project! this cpp project will have several phases, starting with me building a rudimentary tic tac toe game that allows 2 players to play together, and ending with a tic tac toe game against a backtracking algorithm that will (hopefully) result in wins or draws only.

## timeline
1. create program that prints out tic tac toe grid and is able to take next move from 2 users
2. instead of 2 users, only one user plays against a computer that randomly places pieces on the tic tac toe board
3. using a backtracking algorithm, the machine would play against the user and either get a win or draw
