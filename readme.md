# tic tac toe
welcome to my tic tac toe project! this cpp project will have several phases, starting with me building a rudimentary tic tac toe game that allows 2 players to play together, and ending with a tic tac toe game against a backtracking algorithm that will (hopefully) result in wins or draws only.

## timeline
1. create program that prints out tic tac toe grid and is able to take next move from 2 users
2. instead of 2 users, only one user plays against a computer that randomly places pieces on the tic tac toe board
3. using a backtracking algorithm, the machine would play against the user and either get a win or draw
