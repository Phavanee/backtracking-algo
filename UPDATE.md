halfway through the project i realized that a backtracking algorithm was only feasible only if i let two computers play against each other, and let one computer be able to backtrack... oops?    
but since i was making a game with a player against a computer, this project would have to be indefinitely put on hold until i feel confident enough to build a backtracking algorithm (probably when i finally take my dsa classes lol)    
for now making tic-tac-toe would just be an exploration into data structures in c++ :)
